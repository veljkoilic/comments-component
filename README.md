# Frontend Mentor - Interactive comments section solution



This is a solution to the [Interactive comments section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9).

  
## Installation: ```git clone, npm i, npm start```

  

### The challenge

  

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies

- Upvote and downvote comments

-  **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.

-  **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

  

### Built with


- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

    

### What I learned

  I tried doing this challenge as fast as possible. This resulted in creating this whole section using one functional component. The challenge would have been easier if i used two components. I learned to handle components that are  larger than the ones I usually create.
  I practiced spreading in and splicing up objects in order to manipulate the main state object containing comments.
